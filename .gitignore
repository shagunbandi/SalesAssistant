#   having no cross-platform support, pipenv may install dependencies that don't work, or not
#   install all needed dependencies.

# Poetry
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include poetry.lock in version control.
#   This is especially recommended for binary packages to ensure reproducibility, and is more
#   commonly ignored for libraries.

#   For a library or package, you might want to ignore these files since the code is
